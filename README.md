Weather App

Will allow a user to input a location and be able to view the weather for the location. User can input more than one city and see the weather for all cities inputted. If a city wants to be removed there is a button to remove it.

API allows for a decent amount of pulls before it fails and you will need to wait some time to be able to use it again.
